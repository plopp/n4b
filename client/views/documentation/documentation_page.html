          Rules make up a scenario and an individual rule changes value of a resource in the house. A rule is created for example to turn on an outlet, and another to turn it off. To create a rule, create a new scenario or chose an existing one, and then press "+ Add rule". When a rule is created, a resource is to be selected, its value chosen and a timerule defined to tell the system when this rule should apply. A timerule spawns recurring occurrences stating when the rule should take effect. To create a rule, for example assign the timerule a value such as "every 2 hours starting at the 1st hour" to create a rule which takes effect at 13:00, 15:00, 17:00 etc.
